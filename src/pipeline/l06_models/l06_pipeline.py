def run_layer_06(data: Tuple[pd.DataFrame, pd.Series, pd.DataFrame, pd.Series]):
    """
    This function processes the data from the training and testing stages and returns the trained final model.

    **Parameters:**
    - `data_tuple` (tuple): A tuple containing the training and testing data:
      - `x_train` (np.ndarray): The input features for the training data.
      - `y_train` (np.ndarray): The target labels for the training data.
      - `x_test` (np.ndarray): The input features for the test data.
      - `y_test` (np.ndarray): The target labels for the test data.

    **Returns:**
    - `model` (tensorflow.keras.Model): The trained model after training and hyperparameter tuning.
    
    **Usage Example:**
    ```python
    model = run_layer_06((x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test))
    ```

    **Note:**
    This function will be extended later to perform:
    - Hyperparameter tuning using `keras_tuner`.
    - Model training using the best hyperparameters.
    - Model evaluation with metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
    - Saving the trained model and its configuration in MLflow.
